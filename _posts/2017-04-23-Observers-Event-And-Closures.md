title: Observers, Events and Closures

### Introduction

In my last post ([Delegates vs Closures in Swift]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _posts/2017-04-23-Observers-Event-And-Closures.md %})), I mentioned that there were problems in removing closures from arrays. This post is the first in a small series, describing an implementation of the **Observer Pattern** as a system of events and closures. It will also cover an interesting approach to implementing delegates.

Instead of relying on my previous article as a starting point, I intend to start again from scratch, as there are several changes, even to the most fundamental of types and associated code.

#### Closures

Whereas, in the previous article, closure types were simply type aliases for closure signatures, due to the inability to successfully remove them from arrays, we needed to come up with a solution that would allow correct handling in arrays.

Two possibilities came to mind:

  * The first was to use a wrapper struct or class but that overcomplicated the syntax for the user code

  * The second was (possibly) surprising; [an enum with an associated value](#enums-for-closures) for the closure.

### A Base Args Type

In the previous article, we used a base EventArgs class and inherited other args classes from that but, in the spirit of **protocol oriented programming** that Swift encourages, we now have an empty protocol, which can be implemented by either a class or a struct.

```swift
public protocol EventArgs { }

public struct EmptyArgs : EventArgs { }
```

Then, for those closures which don't require any parameters, we have a simple, empty struct that implements the EventArgs protocol.

### A Base Closure Protocol

In order to store a list of [closure enums](#enums-for-closures), which can all have differing closure signatures, we are going to need a common type:

  1. for the benefit of the array
  2. so that we can invoke the closure generically

```swift
public protocol Closure : Hashable
{
  associatedtype SenderType
  
  func invoke<argsT : EventArgs>(sender: SenderType, args: argsT)
}

extension Closure
{
  public static func ==(lhs: Self, rhs: Self) -> Bool
  {
    return lhs.hashValue == rhs.hashValue
  }
}
```

Because our enum types are being stored in arrays, they will have to conform to the Equatable protocol; but I have decided to inherit our Closure protocol from Hashable, which will allow us to implement Equatable by comparing the hashValue, and will also give us the ability to manage them in dictionaries, should we so wish.

The `==` static method for Equatable can be implemented by default in an extension the the Closure protocol, since it only needs to access the `hashValue` that is part of the Hashable protocol.

For any given closure, for a single event type, the closure's sender will always be of the same type as the event's sender; therefore, we can use an associated type for the sender in the `invoke(…)` method.

However, the type of the args object that we will pass to the closure can vary, according to the number and type of parameters we want to pass to the handling closure; this means we need to make this method generic, adding a type parameter for the args type that conforms to the [base args type](#a-base-args-type).

### Enums for Closures

The idea of using an enum to hold an associated value of a closure might sound unusal so, hoping that a real example will be clearer than theory, I will start with the example of a closure for use with the NotifyPropertyChanged protocol we discussed in the previous article.

We are going to need the EventClosure typealias for our bare closure type:

```swift
public typealias EventClosure<senderT, argsT : EventArgs> = (senderT, argsT) -> ()
```

… and the PropertyChangedEventArgs type, which is now a struct:

```swift
public struct PropertyChangedEventArgs : EventArgs
{
  public static let allProperties = PropertyChangedEventArgs(propertyName: nil)
  
  public let propertyName: String?
}
```

Let's take this one step at a time:

```swift
public enum PropertyChangeClosureType<senderT> : Closure
{
  case didChange(EventClosure<senderT, PropertyChangedEventArgs>)
  
  …
```

The essence of this enum is the list of cases; in this simple example, there is only one, `didChange`.

The senderT type parameter is necessary for this closure type, because the `NotifyPropertyChanged` protocol can be implemented by virtually any type.

We declare the `didChange` case with an associated value of the type that matches the closure signature associated with the `propertyChanged` event in the `NotifyPropertyChanged` protocol.
  
```swift
  …
  
  public func invoke<argsT : EventArgs>(sender: senderT, args: argsT)
  {
    switch self
    {
      case .didChange(let closure):
        closure(sender, args as! PropertyChangedEventArgs)
    }
  }
}
```

The `invoke(…)`method in this example might seem a bit overly complicated, with a switch statement for a single case, but, for when there are more cases, I wanted to demonstrate clearly the principle of extracting the closure from the associated value and how to call it.

Since the args parameter is passed in as a generic argsT type, we need to explicitly cast it to the correct type for the closure associated with this case.

```swift
extension TextFieldEventClosureType : Hashable
{
  public var hashValue: Int
  {
    switch self
    {
      case .didChange(_):
        return 0
    }
  }
}
```

**Note:** Swift doesn't allow enums to be "RawRepresentable" and to also have associated values, which is why we have had to implement Hashable by returning an Int value for each of the cases. 

To give you some idea of how a more complex enum would be implemented, here is one designed to fulfil the needs of an imitation of the UITextFieldDelegate:

```swift
public enum TextFieldEventClosureType : Closure
{
  case shouldBeginEditing(TextFieldPermissionClosure)
  case didBeginEditing(EventClosure<TextField, EventArgs>)
  case shouldEndEditing(TextFieldPermissionClosure)
  case didEndEditing(TextFieldDidEndEditingClosure)
  case shouldChangeCharacters(TextFieldShouldChangeCharactersClosure)
  case shouldClear(TextFieldPermissionClosure)
  case shouldReturn(TextFieldPermissionClosure)
  
  public func invoke<argsT : EventArgs>(sender: TextField, args: argsT)
  {
    switch self
    {
      case .shouldBeginEditing(let closure):
        closure(sender, args as! PermissionArgs)
      case .didBeginEditing(let closure):
        closure(sender, args)
      case .shouldEndEditing(let closure):
        closure(sender, args as! PermissionArgs)
      case .didEndEditing(let closure):
        closure(sender, args as! TextFieldDidEndEditingArgs)
      case .shouldChangeCharacters(let closure):
        closure(sender, args as! TextFieldShouldChangeCharactersArgs)
      case .shouldClear(let closure):
        closure(sender, args as! PermissionArgs)
      case .shouldReturn(let closure):
        closure(sender, args as! PermissionArgs)
    }
  }
}

extension TextFieldEventClosureType : Hashable
{
  public var hashValue: Int
  {
    switch self
    {
    case .shouldBeginEditing(_):
        return 0
      case .didBeginEditing(_):
        return 1
      case .shouldEndEditing(_):
        return 2
      case .didEndEditing(_):
        return 3
      case .shouldChangeCharacters(_):
        return 4
      case .shouldClear(_):
        return 5
      case .shouldReturn(_):
        return 6
    }
  }
}
```

These **closure enums** are used, when attaching a method to an event, in the following manner:

```swift
    testSubject.propertyChanged += .didChange(testObject.propertyDidChange)
```

… or, using a closure, like this:

```swift
    testSubject.propertyChanged += .didChange
    {
      sender, args in
      
      guard let propertyName = args.propertyName else
      {
        // more than one property has changed
        
        return
      }
      
      if propertyName == "name"
      {
        print("\"\(sender.name)\" has been assigned to \(propertyName)")
      }
    }
```

### The Event Class

Now that we are using enums with associated closures, we need to change the Event class to accomodate this.

```swift
public func +=<closureT : Closure, argsT : EventArgs>(_ event: Event<closureT, argsT>, closure: closureT)
{
  event.add(closure)
}

public func -=<closureT : Closure, argsT : EventArgs>(_ event: Event<closureT, argsT>, closure: closureT)
{
  event.remove(closure)
}

public class Event<closureT : Closure, argsT : EventArgs>
{
  // MARK: private properties
  
  private lazy var eventClosures: [closureT] =
  {
    return [closureT]()
  }()
  
  private let sender: closureT.SenderType
  
  // MARK: - fileprivate methods
  
  fileprivate func add(_ closure: closureT)
  {
    eventClosures.append(closure)
  }
  
  fileprivate func remove(_ closure: closureT)
  {
    if let index = eventClosures.index(of: closure)
    {
      let _ = eventClosures.remove(at: index)
    }
  }
  
  // MARK: - contructors
  
  public init(sender: closureT.SenderType)
  {
    self.sender = sender;
  }
  
  // MARK: - public methods
  
  public func invoke(with args: argsT)
  {
    eventClosures.forEach
    {
      $0.invoke(sender: sender, args: args)
    }
  }
}
```

The Event type still has two generic type parameters but, this time, we use the closureT to determine the sender's type; the argsT type is still required for the `invoke(…)`method and it is not part of the closureT type.

The **closure enums** are held in an array of `closureT`; because "closures" are now hidden inside an Equatable enum, they can now be both added and removed from the array; the sender is held in a private let; and the invoke method of the Event simply enumerates teh closure enums, calling the invoke(…) method on each in turn.

### The NotifyPropertyChanged Protocol

Now we have all the required types in place, we can move on to create the NotifyPropertyChanged protocol that we can implement on any type, of which we wish to observe property changes.

```swift
public protocol NotifyPropertyChanged
{
  associatedtype ClosureType : Closure
  
  var propertyChanged: Event<ClosureType, PropertyChangedEventArgs> { get }
}
```

Notice the ClosureType associated type declaration, which will be replaced by an implementation of the Closure protocol. This is used as the first parameter to the Event<closureT, argsT> class and, in this example, we are using the PropertyChangedEventArgs type we discussed earlier, as the argsT replacement type.

### The Test Subject

The test subject class is relatively unchanged, with only the parameter type to the Event being different.

```swift
public class TestSubject : NotifyPropertyChanged
{
  public lazy var propertyChanged: Event<PropertyChangeClosureType<TestSubject>, PropertyChangedEventArgs> =
  {
    return Event<PropertyChangeClosureType<TestSubject>, PropertyChangedEventArgs>(sender: self)
  }()

  public var name: String = ""
  {
    didSet
    {
      let args = PropertyChangedEventArgs(propertyName: "name")
      
      propertyChanged.invoke(with: args)
    }
  }
}
```

### A Test Object

Creating a type, that contains the closures to handle the event, is identical to previously:

```swift
public class TestClass
{
  public func propertyDidChange(sender: TestSubject, args: PropertyChangedEventArgs)
  {
    guard let propertyName = args.propertyName else
    {
      // more than one property has changed
      
      return
    }
    
    if propertyName == "name"
    {
      print("\"\(sender.name)\" has been assigned to \(propertyName)")
    }
  }
  
  public func propertyDidChange(sender: AnotherSubject, args: PropertyChangedEventArgs)
  {
    guard let propertyName = args.propertyName else
    {
      // more than one property has changed
      
      return
    }
    
    if propertyName == "name"
    {
      print("\"\(sender.name)\" has been assigned to \(propertyName)")
    }
  }
}
```

Although, one thing I didn't mention last time, was that you can create multiple methods with the same signature, but with different sender parameter type; and Swift will allow this, overloading the method name to provide handling for as many, strictly typed, closures as you have types of subjects.

### Bringing Everything Together

To tie everything together, here is some test code that creates an instance of TestSubject and TestClass, and then hooks them together:

```swift
{
  func test()
  {
    let testObject = TestClass()
    
    let testSubject = TestSubject()
    
    // use this to capture the event in another object
    testSubject.propertyChanged += .didChange(testObject.propertyDidChange)
    
    // use this to capture the event in the current object
    testSubject.propertyChanged += .didChange
    {
      sender, args in
      
      guard let propertyName = args.propertyName else
      {
        // more than one property has changed
        
        return
      }
      
      if propertyName == "name"
      {
        print("\"\(sender.name)\" has been assigned to \(propertyName)")
      }
    }
    
    testSubject.name = "Swift"
  }
}
```

Using a closure in the code that links the subject, instead of a method in another object, means that we can capture information from the enclosing type, which can sometimes be very useful if we need to refer to that information in order to do validation at the time of closure execution; although this scenario applies more to args types that contain vars that can be altered to provide feedback to the subject type.

### Next…

If you look at the [TextFieldEventClosureType](#UITextFieldDelegate) code, you will see that there are seven events, all of which we might want capture in a single object. In the next article, I intend to show how we can create a delegate mechanism that will allow us to add a single object as delegate for all those events in one line of code.
