title: Observers, Events and Closures

### Introduction

In my last post ([Delegates vs Closures in Swift](https://joannamacdev.github.io/Delegates-And-Closures/)) I mentioned that there were problems in removing closures from arrays. This post is the first in a small series, describing an implmentation of the **Observer Pattern** as a system of events and closures. It will also cover an interesting approach to implementing delegates.
